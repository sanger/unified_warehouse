# This script provides the funcionality to use the service for
# testing purposes inside a Docker container. It allows you to
#
# - Initialize the testing database when INTEGRATION_TEST_SETUP is set
# - Start the service
#

# Default behaviour in bash is that a line with a failure doesnt break
# the script, but it carries on. With these set of flags defined, if there is an
# error during the script it will break; this minimise unexpected behaviours
# in the script during a failure (like a fail in the condition check that
# carries on and runs the next line).
