# If you wish to switch broadcast mode when in development

# For example
# `WARREN_TYPE=broadcast bundle exec rails s`
# This will override the setting in warren.yml

  # Log mode does not actually use this configuration, but
  # it is provided for convenience when broadcast mode is enabled.
  # The provided settings are the default options of RabbitMQ
  # DO NOT commit sensitive information in this file. Instead you may
  # use the WARREN_CONNECTION_URI environment variable
